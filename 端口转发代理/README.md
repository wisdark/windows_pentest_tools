### HTTP Proxy for windows
*AnalogX - Basic proxy, looks like few options to limit access or prevent LAN networks from using it.

* 3Proxy - GUI-less program. The ones that sometimes verify the proxy need a GUI.

* EaseGate - Haven't gotten that one to run yet. Apache is used to configure it, and my test server (bare-bones 2008R2 install) refuses to start Apache.

* ProxyDE - GUI-less program. The ones that sometimes verify the proxy need a GUI.

* CCProxy - Looks promising. But haven't delved deeply into that one yet.

Besides the above, I ran across some InternetCafe-software packages, but all of those do not run a proxy, but merely allow for certain internal clients (who all need an install of the client-side software of the package) to either access or not access the internet directly.
